# F3D Rust Bindings

Rust bindings for the [f3d](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d).

⚠️ Early development notice
This project is in a very early stage and the API is unstable. A lot of features are missing, and there will be breaking changes. Use at your own risk.

I’m still learning Rust, and much of this work was done with the help of ChatGPT, so expect rough edges, unidiomatic code, and breaking changes.

## Building
Add the dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
f3d = {git = "https://github.com/AoGao-Kedoka/f3d-rust"}
``````
